# Image-Colour-Classification
These projects focus on colour classification and analysis using deep learning techniques. The Colour Classification project involves a model that predicts colours in images, while the Complete Colour Code project expands on this by providing a more detailed analysis of colours in a fashion dataset.

# Datasets
Both projects use the [Fashion Product Images (Small)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small) dataset, which contains images of various fashion products. The dataset includes a wide range of images, which are used to train and test the deep learning models for colour analysis.


# Complete Colour Code Project
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of colours in fashion product images. It uses deep learning models to identify and categorize colours, and then analyses these colours to understand trends in fashion products.
## Dependencies
- TensorFlow (latest version)
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Key Steps:
- Upgrade TensorFlow to the latest version.
- Preprocess the images using OpenCV.
- Train a deep learning model to classify colours.
- Analyze the results using various data visualization techniques.

# Colour Classification Project
This project involves the development of a deep learning model to classify colours in images. The model is trained using TensorFlow and can identify different colours in fashion product images.
## Dependencies
- TensorFlow 2.11.0

## Key Steps:
- Install TensorFlow 2.11.0.
- Load the pre-trained model and preprocess the images.
- Predict the colours in the images using the trained model.

# Usage
To run these projects, follow the instructions provided in their respective Jupyter notebooks. Ensure all dependencies are installed and the dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. Adjust the file paths in the code to point to the location of the dataset on your machine.

# Conclusion
These projects demonstrate the power of deep learning in the field of fashion, specifically in colour analysis and classification. By leveraging the Fashion Product Images dataset, the projects provide insights into colour trends and preferences in fashion products.
